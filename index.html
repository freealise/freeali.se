<h1>What was only possible with electronic music has become a real instrument.</h1>
<p>
12-step equal temperament is a universally accepted balance between harmony, usability and variety of note combinations.
The prominence of it in modern music causes artists to revisit chord patterns and melodies without being original.
Previously only keyboard programmers or multitouch device and software synth owners could avoid these limits.
Now you can achieve the same by playing the microtonal electric guitar in tapping style and keep in tune.
</p>

[ascii art with details]

The microtonal guitar has an aluminium surface in place of frets. It has 12 strings and 
play music outside of equal temperament
