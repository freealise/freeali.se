<h2>What was only possible with electronic music has become a real instrument.</h2>
<p>
12-step equal temperament is a universally accepted balance between harmony, usability and variety of note combinations.
The prominence of it in modern music causes artists to revisit chord patterns and melodies without being original.
Previously only keyboard programmers or multitouch device and software synth owners could avoid these limits.
Now you can achieve the same by playing the microtonal electric guitar in tapping style and keep in tune.

    <b>&lt; Aluminium surface in place of frets</b><br/>
    The fret markings are laser engraved, so they do not wear off.<br/><br/>

    <b>&lt; 12 strings with any tuning guitars can have</b><br/>
    Tune the strings to the same intervals between them and find chords easily.<br/><br/>

    <b>&lt; Shoulder strap to hold it while you stand or sit</b><br/>
    Hold the guitar upside down so the distances between the notes look the same anywhere.<br/><br/>

    <b>&lt; Usual output jack, humbuckers, machine heads and truss rod</b><br/>
    The solid body of the instrument is made of light bamboo wood, which has no effect on tone or sustain.
